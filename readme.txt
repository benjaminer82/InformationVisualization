Hi Aaron,

The codes I made are for 2D and 3D treemaps. The 3 VRML files are generated on my laptop, and the target directory is the Java application on my C drive.
The Treemap.java file is the one which can generate 3D treemaps and the Treemap2D.java file is the one which can generate 2D treemaps.
Thank you very much. 
All the best.
Have a nice vocation.

yours,
Benny
